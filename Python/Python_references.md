# Python for Novice

## Introduction

> [Python](https://www.python.org/) is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
> It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to 
> object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, 
> together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting 
> and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. <cite>[A byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/)

There are several Python tutorials available for beginners, therefore rather than creating a new tutorial we considered putting them together.

# Topics to be discussed

1. How To - 'Hello World'
2. Literal Constants: integers, floats and strings
3. Variables: use them in python commands (slicing, splicing, overwriting)
4. Operators and Expressions: plus, minus, multiply, power, divide, less/greater than, boolean and, or, not
5. Sets and Lists: define and access list (min, max, index, sort, unique, append, reverse, combine, sum, intersect, string to list etc.)
6. The if-statements: making choices and defining conditionals
7. For-loop: repeated tasks like reading multiple files for same action
8. Choosing editors to write Python programs
9. Basic rules: comments, quote, indentation, newline, tabs
10. File handling: create, read, write, open, close
11. Functions
12. Import packages and work with them: os, sys, numpy, matplotlib
13. Perform operations on arrays of data.
14. Display simple graphs
15. Basic error and exceptions: try and except
